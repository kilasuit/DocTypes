# InspiredBy

Do ya remember tweets or other posts with things like TIL: or ICYMI: which are `Today I Learned` & `In Case You Missed It`,  if you do then you likely have a memory like mine, and if your dont then during for some learning opportunities here and that's what this project is all about.

This project has been inspired by lots of things I'm mostly from my time as  consulting across different organisations but also my time from all previous I parts of my life I'm search I will try and get back to this particular document and detail where I've been inspired by other other things like the ADR's which is obviously say [architecture decision records]() or Any this is records is that now going to be now you know it's so much easier to dictate me type even if quite a bit of it is wrong and earn

However the real inspiration for this project is upcoming software engineers of all types, of future generations, like my children, or your children, as well as those coming into the industry from other areas.
