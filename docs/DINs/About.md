# DINs

I expect there will be many DINs for this project,

as such, if you want to you can write 1 or more DIN/s and add it under this folder & you must add your DIN/s in the DINs folder and in a folder of your own using your username for the folder name. This is because we will add you as a codeowner to that folder, ensuring you get notified of any changes that others may makke of your contributions
